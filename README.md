<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="justify">
    The article aims to analyze knowledge-based systems that use well-defined rules to play the Google Dinosaur game and achieve the highest possible score. The intelligent agent defined by rules will be responsible for choosing the keys during the game. After development, a comparison of results will be made using statistical tests: paired t-test and non-parametric Wilcoxon test, between the agent developed by the Artificial Intelligence course professor, Flávio Miguel Varejão, and the agent developed in the article, which was inspired by the professor's agent and the classifier created in the second work.
